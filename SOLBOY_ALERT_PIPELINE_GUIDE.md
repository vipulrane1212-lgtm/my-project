## 👤 About Solboy

**Who I am:**  
Been in the Solana memecoin space since the early days. I've seen the cycles, the pumps, the rugs, and everything in between. Over time, I've built a system that filters through the noise to find real opportunities.

**My approach:**  
I don't call everything. I wait for multiple sources to align — when XTRACK, Glydo, whale wallets, and momentum all point in the same direction. That's when I know it's worth your attention.

**My sources:**  
I monitor 12+ premium Telegram sources including:
- **XTRACK SOL NEW** — Primary entry trigger (2x/3x cohort detection)
- **Glydo** — Top 5 trending heatmap tracking
- **WhaleBuy** — Large wallet activity
- **SOL SB1, SOL SB/MB** — Tracked wallet snipes
- **Momentum Tracker** — Price spike detection
- **Large Buys Tracker** — Significant buy activity
- **KOLscope, SpyDefi, Call Analyzer** — Additional confirmation sources
- **Solana Early Trending** — Early momentum signals

---

## ⚙️ How the Alert System Works

### The Pipeline Process

```
1. XTRACK Signal Detected
   ↓
2. Token reaches 2x/3x on XTRACK (COHORT START)
   ↓
3. System checks for confirmations within ±30 minutes:
   • Glydo Top 5 appearance (±20 min window)
   • Momentum spikes (>25% in <30s)
   • Large buys (>5 SOL single buy)
   • Multi-buy activity (≥2 wallets)
   • Whale buy confirmations
   • Early trending posts
   ↓
4. Entry MC validation (30K-150K range)
   ↓
5. Tier assignment based on criteria
   ↓
6. Alert formatted with themed intro
   ↓
7. Alert sent to subscribers + Twitter (TIER 1 only)
```

### Key Concepts

**Cohort Start:**  
The moment a token first hits 2x or 3x on XTRACK. This is when the opportunity window opens.

**Confirmation Window:**  
±30 minutes from cohort start. All confirmations must occur within this window to count.

**Glydo Top 5 Window:**  
±20 minutes from cohort start. If token appears in Glydo's top 5 trending list within this window, it's a strong signal.

**Entry Market Cap:**  
The token's market cap at the cohort start. Optimal ranges:
- **TIER 1:** $40K - $100K
- **TIER 2:** $30K - $120K
- **TIER 3:** $30K - $150K

**Hot List Status:**  
Indicates if the token was in Glydo's top 5 before the cohort started (warmed up) or not (cold entry).

## 🎯 Understanding Tiered Strategy

The strategy uses a **3-tier system** based on validated criteria:

### 🚀 TIER 1 ULTRA — Highest Conviction

**Criteria:**
- ✅ XTRACK ≥2x cohort detected
- ✅ Glydo Top 5 appearance (±20 min from cohort)
- ✅ ≥1 strong confirmation (momentum spike, large buy, whale buy, or early trending)
- ✅ Entry MC: $40K - $100K

**What this means:**  
Multiple premium sources aligned. Token is trending on Glydo, has strong momentum, and is in the optimal MC range. This is your highest probability play.

**Special Features:**
- **Twitter Posting:** Automatically posted to Twitter for maximum visibility
- **Priority Alerts:** Highest conviction plays — act fast

**Trading Approach:**
- **Entry:** As soon as alert received
- **Position Size:** Larger allocation (3-5% of trading capital)
- **Target:** 5x-10x+ (let winners run)
- **Stop Loss:** 30-40% below entry

---

### 🔥 TIER 2 HIGH — Strong Setup

**Criteria:**
- ✅ XTRACK ≥2x cohort detected
- ✅ Glydo Top 5 appearance (±20 min from cohort)
- ✅ ≥1 confirmation (any type)
- ✅ Entry MC: $30K - $120K

**What this means:**  
Token is trending on Glydo and has at least one confirmation signal. Solid opportunity with good risk/reward.

**Trading Approach:**
- **Entry:** Within 2-3 minutes of alert
- **Position Size:** Medium allocation (2-3% of trading capital)
- **Target:** 4x-7x
- **Stop Loss:** 35-45% below entry

---

### ⚡ TIER 3 MEDIUM — Good Opportunity

**Criteria:**
- ✅ XTRACK ≥2x cohort detected
- ✅ Either:
  - ≥2 non-Glydo confirmations, OR
  - Delayed Glydo appearance (>30 min after cohort)

**What this means:**  
Multiple confirmations without Glydo top 5, or Glydo appeared later. Still a valid opportunity but with lower conviction than Tier 1/2.

**Trading Approach:**
- **Entry:** Within 3-5 minutes of alert
- **Position Size:** Smaller allocation (1-2% of trading capital)
- **Target:** 3x-5x
- **Stop Loss:** 40-50% below entry

## 🔍 Alert Format & Features

### Alert Structure

Every alert contains:

1. **Header:** Tier and confidence level with emoji
2. **Token Info:** 🔥 Token name, current market cap, and contract address (on separate line for easy copying)
3. **Spicy Intro:** Themed 5-6 line paragraph based on trigger conditions (40 unique templates)
4. **Why it triggered:** Breakdown of criteria met (tier badge, confirmations)
5. **Confirmations:** Specific signals detected (Glydo, momentum, whale buys, etc.)
6. **Contract Address:** In code block format for easy copying
7. **Quick Links:** Chart, GMGN, Rugcheck
8. **Metadata:** Cohort time, Hot List status
9. **Footer:** Monitored by solboy (clickable link to channel)

### Themed Intro Paragraphs

Each alert includes a unique 5-6 line intro paragraph that's dynamically selected based on trigger conditions:

- **Glydo Heatmap Dominance** (10 templates) — When Glydo top 5 is present
- **Momentum Spike Mania** (10 templates) — When momentum spikes detected
- **Smart Money Snipes** (10 templates) — When whale/large buys detected
- **Early Trending + Mixed** (10 templates) — When early trending/volume/KOL signals present

The system automatically selects the appropriate theme and randomly picks one intro from that theme, then substitutes dynamic variables like `{token_symbol}`, `{momentum_pct}`, `{buy_sol}`, etc.

### Example Alert Format

```
🚨 **ALPHA INCOMING — TIER 3 LOCKED** ⚡ MEDIUM

🔥 **UNFUN**
Current MC: **$118.6K**

`HPJVIHKEXLMGTVMA9ISFUFAERLXVCXKMFMIHNQBYU6GM`

Early echo chamber: UNFUN trending early, KOLs echoing—chamber's filling with buy pressure. Volume's the bass drop. Cohort dropped the beat. Hot List? Front row. Drop in.

Why it triggered:
⚡ **TIER 3**
✓ 2 confirmation(s)

📊 Volume spike detected
📈 Early Trending posted

⏰ Cohort: 1s ago
💧 Hot List: 🔴 No

📊 Chart (https://dexscreener.com/...) • 🎯 GMGN (https://gmgn.ai/...) • 🔍 Rugcheck (https://rugcheck.xyz/...)

— Monitored by solboy (https://t.me/solboy_calls)
```

### Key Metrics to Check

**1. Entry Market Cap**  
- **Optimal:** $40K - $100K (TIER 1 range)
- **Acceptable:** $30K - $120K (TIER 2 range)
- **Watch:** $120K+ (may be too late)

**2. Current Market Cap**  
- Compare to entry MC to see if already pumped
- If current MC is 2x+ entry MC, may be late
- If current MC is close to entry MC, still early

**3. Glydo Top 5 Status**  
- **🟢 In Top 5:** Strong signal (TIER 1/2)
- **🔴 Not in Top 5:** Lower conviction (TIER 3)

**4. Confirmations**  
- **Strong confirmations:** Momentum spike, large buy, whale buy, early trending
- **Multiple confirmations:** Better signal strength
- **Specific details:** Check SOL amounts, momentum percentages

**5. Hot List Status**  
- **🟢 Yes:** Token was in Glydo top 5 before cohort (warmed up)
- **🔴 No:** Cold entry (may still be good, but less warmed up)

**6. Cohort Time**  
- How long ago the cohort started
- **0-5 minutes:** Very early, best entry
- **5-15 minutes:** Still good, but may have moved
- **15+ minutes:** May be late, check current MC vs entry MC

## 📈 Trading Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Alert Received** ⚡
- Check tier immediately
- TIER 1 = highest priority, act fast
- TIER 2/3 = still good, but less urgent

**2. Quick Checks (30 seconds)** 🔍
- Copy contract address (on separate line for easy selection)
- Open DexScreener chart (click link in alert)
- Check current MC vs entry MC
- Verify it's not already 3x+ from entry
- Read the themed intro paragraph for context on why it triggered

**3. Rugcheck (1 minute)** 🛡️
- Click Rugcheck link
- Verify:
  - ✅ No honeypot
  - ✅ LP locked or burned
  - ✅ No mint function
  - ✅ Owner renounced (if possible)

**4. Chart Analysis (1-2 minutes)** 📊
- Check price action
- Look for:
  - Steady uptrend
  - Healthy pullbacks
  - Volume increasing
  - No major dumps

**5. Entry Decision** 💰
- **TIER 1:** Enter immediately if checks pass
- **TIER 2:** Enter within 2-3 minutes
- **TIER 3:** Enter within 3-5 minutes, but be more selective

**6. Position Management** 📊
- Set mental stop loss
- Take partial profits at targets
- Let winners run (especially TIER 1)
- Don't FOMO if you miss entry

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Position Sizing Guidelines

**TIER 1 ULTRA:**
- Allocate 3-5% of trading capital
- Higher conviction = larger size
- Still respect risk limits

**TIER 2 HIGH:**
- Allocate 2-3% of trading capital
- Medium conviction = medium size

**TIER 3 MEDIUM:**
- Allocate 1-2% of trading capital
- Lower conviction = smaller size

### Stop Loss Strategy

**Never risk more than you can afford to lose.**

- **TIER 1:** 30-40% stop loss
- **TIER 2:** 35-45% stop loss
- **TIER 3:** 40-50% stop loss

**Mental stops are fine** — you don't need to set exchange stops (can get front-run).

### Profit Taking

**Partial Profit Strategy:**
- **2x:** Take 25-30% profit
- **3x:** Take another 25-30% profit
- **5x+:** Let the rest run (especially TIER 1)

**Full Exit:**
- If token reaches 10x+ and shows weakness
- If major dump occurs (>30% in minutes)
- If original thesis breaks (rugcheck issues, etc.)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **FOMO Entry** — Don't chase if already 3x+ from entry  
❌ **No Rugcheck** — Always verify before buying  
❌ **Oversizing** — Stick to position sizing rules  
❌ **No Stop Loss** — Have an exit plan  
❌ **Holding Losers** — Cut losses quickly  
❌ **Ignoring Tier** — TIER 3 needs more caution than TIER 1

## ❓ FAQ

### How often will I get alerts?

Alerts are sent only when high-quality opportunities are detected:
- Distribution is uneven — some hours may have multiple alerts, others may have none
- Quality over quantity — we filter out most tokens to only send high-quality signals

### What if I miss an alert?

- **If <5 minutes old:** Still worth checking
- **If 5-15 minutes old:** Check current MC vs entry MC
- **If >15 minutes old:** Likely too late, wait for next alert

### Can I trade all tiers?

Yes, but:
- **TIER 1:** Highest priority, act fast
- **TIER 2:** Good opportunities, less urgent
- **TIER 3:** More selective, smaller size

**Tier Filtering:**  
You can customize which tier alerts you receive using `/set` command:
- `/set t1` — Only TIER 1 alerts
- `/set t1,t2` — TIER 1 and TIER 2 alerts
- `/set all` — All tiers (default)

### What if a token doesn't pump?

Not every alert will be a winner. This is why risk management is crucial. Always:
- Use proper position sizing
- Set stop losses
- Take profits at targets
- Don't FOMO into late entries

### Should I use leverage?

**No.** Memecoins are already high risk. Adding leverage multiplies that risk. Trade spot only.

### What if I see a rugcheck issue?

**Don't enter.** Even if it's TIER 1, if rugcheck shows red flags, skip it. There will be more opportunities.

### Can I share alerts with others?

These alerts are for subscribers only. Please don't share publicly — it dilutes the edge for everyone.

### How do the themed intro paragraphs work?

The system automatically selects one of 40 unique intro templates based on the alert's trigger conditions:
- If Glydo top 5 is present → Glydo Heatmap theme
- If momentum spike detected → Momentum Spike theme
- If whale/large buys detected → Smart Money theme
- If early trending/volume/KOL signals → Early Trending theme

Each intro is randomly selected from its theme and includes dynamic variables like token symbol, momentum percentage, buy amounts, etc.

### Why do TIER 1 alerts get posted to Twitter?

TIER 1 alerts represent the highest conviction plays. Posting to Twitter increases visibility and helps the community catch these premium opportunities in real-time.

## 🎯 Final Tips

1. **Trust the tiers** — TIER 1 is highest conviction for a reason
2. **Always rugcheck** — Never skip this step
3. **Manage risk** — Position size appropriately
4. **Take profits** — Don't be greedy
5. **Cut losses** — Don't hold hoping for recovery
6. **Stay patient** — Not every alert is worth trading
7. **DYOR** — This is a tool, not financial advice
8. **Read the intro** — The themed paragraph gives context on why it triggered
